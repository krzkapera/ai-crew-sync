//! `ai-crew-sync mcp proxy`: a local stdio MCP server that forwards every
//! tool call to the remote bus as **one** agent in **one** session.
//!
//! Why a proxy at all: the bus is stateless Streamable HTTP and any MCP client
//! can talk to it directly. What a direct connection cannot do is give each
//! *conversation* its own session when several windows open the same
//! repository with the same token — a header set once in a client config is
//! the same header in every window. A stdio server is started by the host
//! once per conversation (that is the MCP norm, and what Claude Code and
//! Codex do), so the process itself is the unit of isolation: it mints the
//! session label, sends it on every forwarded request, and keeps the
//! project/role metadata for exactly that window.
//!
//! The proxy is host-agnostic. What a host provides is used as an
//! enrichment, never required:
//!
//! - **Conversation identity**, in order: `--host-session` / `BUS_HOST_SESSION`
//!   (any host that can set per-window environment), `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`
//!   (Claude Code exports it to MCP server processes), the `_meta.threadId`
//!   Codex attaches to every `tools/call`, and otherwise the process itself
//!   — a random id that lives as long as this instance. A known conversation
//!   id derives a **stable** session label, so a resumed conversation
//!   reconnects to the same session and a forked one gets a new one.
//! - **Start-of-session context** goes into the `initialize` result's
//!   `instructions`, which every MCP client hands to the model. No hook
//!   needed.
//! - **Presence** is kept by the proxy itself: a heartbeat on connect (with
//!   repo and branch read from the project directory), a periodic
//!   keep-alive, `idle` on exit.
//!
//! Two local tools, `configure_session` and `session_status`, never reach the
//! remote server's catalogue. They change metadata (project, role, channel)
//! and, within the same team, the profile; a team change needs a new
//! conversation, because switching credentials cannot erase what this
//! conversation has already seen. Every profile change is verified with
//! `whoami` before it is committed, in-flight calls to the old context are
//! cancelled rather than replayed, and claims or locks held by the old
//! identity are reported, never transferred.
//!
//! Stdout carries MCP framing only; everything else goes to stderr.
