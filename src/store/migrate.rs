//! Moving one conversation's bodies between backends, under supervision.
//!
//! Five steps, and the order is the whole safety argument:
//!
//! 1. **Plan.** Count the messages and bytes, check the target is reachable
//!    and provisioned, and report. Nothing is written, and this is what the
//!    command does unless `--apply` is passed.
//! 2. **Copy.** Every message's body is read from where it is, checksummed,
//!    written to the target under a deterministic idempotency key, and
//!    recorded. The thread keeps working throughout: bodies are still read
//!    from their own recorded backend, which has not changed yet.
//! 3. **Pause and copy the tail.** Writes to this one conversation are
//!    refused, with a message saying why, for as long as the tail takes.
//!    Nothing else on the bus is affected.
//! 4. **Verify.** Every body is read back *from the target* and compared to
//!    the checksum taken from the source. A mismatch fails the move with
//!    the thread untouched.
//! 5. **Cut over.** In one transaction: each verified message's
//!    authoritative backend, then the conversation's routing, then the
//!    pause is lifted.
//!
//! What this never does: invent a receipt, change an author, or delete a
//! source body. Attachments are not involved at all — they hang off channel
//! messages and tasks, they live in Postgres, and no backend move touches
//! them. Cleanup is a
//! separate, explicit operator action after the rollback window, because a
//! rollback that has nothing to roll back to is not a rollback.
