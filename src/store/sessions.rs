//! Session credentials: registration, resume, renewal and revocation.
//!
//! A session credential is derived from an agent token and proves *which
//! window* is calling. Everything it is comes from its parent: agent, team,
//! and the right to authenticate at all. It cannot mint anything, it expires
//! on its own, and a resume fences the connection it replaces (ADR 0001).
//!
//! The one invariant worth stating plainly: **the caller never says who it
//! is**. `register` reads the agent and the team from the token that
//! presented itself, so a client that asks to register "as someone else"
//! simply registers as itself.
