//! Conversations: addressed threads with per-recipient receipts.
//!
//! Every function here answers one of two questions before it does anything
//! else: *may this caller see this thread?* and *may this caller change it?*
//! Both are answered from the credential and from rows, never from a label a
//! caller supplied. A project grant is a row. A private membership is a row.
//! A role a session published for discovery grants nothing at all.
//!
//! Three properties the implementation exists to keep (ADR 0001):
//!
//! 1. **Recipients are snapshotted at acceptance.** `message_recipients` is
//!    written with the message, so a later join never enters an older
//!    message's denominator and a removal never erases a receipt.
//! 2. **Receipts are observations, never inferences.** Reading a thread does
//!    not acknowledge it; a cursor is not a person. `presented_at` stays null
//!    where the host cannot confirm injection, because unknown is not "no".
//! 3. **The exceptional paths are explicit and audited.** A membership
//!    transfer needs the target to accept; owner recovery needs every session
//!    of that agent to be closed, and is read-only.
