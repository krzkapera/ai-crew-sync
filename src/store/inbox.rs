//! Durable per-recipient inbox delivery, for conversations routed to a
//! broker.
//!
//! The shape, and why each step exists:
//!
//! * **References, never bodies.** What a recipient is notified of is the
//!   existence of a message. The body is fetched separately, with a current
//!   ACL check at the moment it is read, so a membership that ended between
//!   the notification and the read stops reading.
//! * **One exact subject and one durable consumer per recipient.** Two
//!   recipients cannot compete for each other's references, and one
//!   acknowledgement cannot drain another's inbox.
//! * **Handing over and committing are two steps.** A client is given
//!   references and says, separately, that it holds them durably; only then
//!   is `delivered_at` written and only then is the broker acknowledged. A
//!   crash in between redelivers, and redelivery is idempotent.
//! * **Postgres is the truth.** The broker is how a recipient finds out
//!   quickly. Everything it holds can be rebuilt from `message_receipts`,
//!   which is exactly what happens after an expiry, a deleted consumer, or a
//!   reference that exceeded its redeliveries.
//!
//! What this does **not** do is wake an idle window. Nothing pushes into a
//! model that is not in a turn, on any host we support, and no broker
//! changes that. Delivery here means the reference reached the process, and
//! it is deliberately a different fact from presented, acknowledged and
//! resolved.
