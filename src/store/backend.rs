//! The messaging backend boundary, and the outbox that exercises it.
//!
//! Phase 2's path is synchronous: body, recipients and receipts commit in one
//! Postgres transaction, so `stored` is true because that transaction
//! committed and there is nothing to reconcile. That remains the default and
//! is not slowed down by anything here.
//!
//! What that path cannot exercise is the shape every external store
//! introduces: acceptance and persistence are two events, and the second can
//! fail, time out, or succeed without the caller learning it did. This module
//! adds that shape with **Postgres as the only implementation**, so the
//! failure handling can be built and tested before there is a broker to
//! blame for it.
//!
//! What the outbox deliberately does *not* do:
//!
//! * it never reports `stored` on acceptance. A message that is accepted and
//!   not yet confirmed says `pending_publication`, which is a different
//!   thing, and a reader sees the gap rather than a lie;
//! * it never skips a pending earlier message when reporting a thread's
//!   state, so a cursor cannot walk past something still in flight;
//! * it never replays a side effect. A retry presents the same `publish_key`
//!   and the adapter is expected to recognise it; a duplicate physical write
//!   resolves to one canonical locator rather than two messages.
