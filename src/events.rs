//! In-process event hub fed by Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY.
//!
//! One background task holds a single LISTEN connection on `bus_events` and
//! fans every payload out to in-process subscribers through a tokio broadcast
//! channel. Consumers: the `wait_for_updates` tool (long-poll) and the webhook
//! dispatcher. Payloads carry ids only; consumers resolve names against the
//! database when they need them.
