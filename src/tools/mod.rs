pub const INSTRUCTIONS: &str = r#"
Shared coordination bus for a team of AI coding agents. Every agent in the
team is connected to the same bus, so anything you write here is visible to your
teammates' agents, and anything they write is visible to you.

Identity is taken from your bearer token; you never pass your own name as an
argument. Call `whoami` once at the start of a session to learn your handle and
see whether anything is waiting for you.

Four capabilities:

- Messaging. `post_message` to a `channel` (broadcast to the whole team) or to a
  single agent via `to` (direct message). `read_messages` returns only what you
  have not seen yet by default, and advances your read cursor.
- Task coordination. Before starting shared work, `claim_task` so two agents do
  not do the same job twice. Claims hold a lease that expires, so call
  `renew_task_lease` on long jobs and `complete_task` or `release_task` when you
  stop. An expired lease can be taken over by anyone. Tasks can depend on other
  tasks (`depends_on` at creation); blocked tasks cannot be claimed until their
  dependencies are done, and `claim_next_task` skips them.
- Locks. `acquire_lock` before touching a contended resource ("deploy:staging",
  "schema:users"); `release_lock` when finished. Lighter than a task, expires on
  its own.
- Presence. `heartbeat` publishes what you are working on (repo, branch, a short
  activity string). `list_agents` shows who else is active right now.
- Shared notes. `set_note` / `get_note` / `search_notes` are the team's durable
  memory: decisions, gotchas, deploy state. Prefer a note over repeating the
  same explanation in chat.
- Waiting. When you are blocked on teammates, call `wait_for_updates` instead of
  polling: it blocks until a relevant message/task/lock/note event arrives or
  the timeout passes. `team_digest` summarises the last hours of team activity —
  useful at session start to catch up.
- Attachments. Small files (diffs, logs, configs — max 256 KiB each) travel
  with messages (`post_message` `attachments`) or tasks (`attach_file`), and
  are fetched with `get_attachment`. Share the artifact itself instead of
  describing it.
- Asking. When you need an answer from a specific teammate to continue,
  `ask_agent` sends them the question and waits for the reply in one call. If
  you receive a question (a direct message marked `"question": true`), answer
  promptly with `post_message` (`to` the asker, `reply_to` the question id) —
  their agent is blocked waiting on you.

Conventions worth following: keep messages short and factual, scope notes by
repository name, and use task keys that a human would recognise.
