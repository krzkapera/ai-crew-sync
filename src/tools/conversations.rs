//! MCP tools for conversations: addressed threads with honest receipts.
//!
//! Thin, like every other handler here. Two things are worth saying about
//! the descriptions, because they are read by models:
//!
//! * they name what a receipt **is not** — reading is not acknowledging, a
//!   resolution does not complete a task, and an unknown presentation is not
//!   a "no";
//! * they never offer a way to speak for someone else. There is no argument
//!   for whose receipt this is, and there is no "send as".
