-- Durable inbox delivery for conversations routed off Postgres.
--
-- Phase 6 of ADR 0001. Two things change, and neither touches a team that
-- has not been routed to a broker:
--
--   * after a body is canonically published, one **reference** per
--     recipient is queued here and published to that recipient's own
--     subject. A reference carries no body: it names the message, and the
--     body is fetched with a current ACL check at the moment it is read.
--   * a receipt change queues a reference for the sender in the same
--     transaction that writes the receipt, so a notification cannot exist
--     without the receipt it reports, or the other way round.
--
-- Postgres remains the truth. The broker is how a recipient finds out
-- quickly; everything it holds can be rebuilt from `message_receipts`,
-- which is what reconciliation does after an expiry or a deleted consumer.
