-- Conversations: addressed threads with honest, per-recipient receipts.
--
-- Channels broadcast and direct messages point at one agent or one window.
-- Neither answers the question a review actually asks: *these three people
-- were asked, which of them has seen it, and which has acted on it?* A
-- channel cannot say; a DM to three people is three threads that never
-- converge.
--
-- A conversation is a thread with an explicit membership, a logical sequence
-- and a recipient snapshot per message, so "who was asked" is a fact about
-- the message rather than a guess from the membership as it looks now.
--
-- Five things this schema is careful about (ADR 0001):
--
--   * **Access is granted, never inferred.** A project grant is a row, not a
--     working directory or a role label. A private conversation's membership
--     is per *session*, so one window of an agent can be in a thread its
--     sibling cannot read.
--   * **Recipients are snapshotted at acceptance.** Someone who joins later
--     never appears in an older message's denominator, and someone removed
--     keeps their historical receipts.
--   * **Receipts are distinct observations.** Stored, delivered, presented,
--     acknowledged and resolved mean different things and are never inferred
--     from each other. A cursor moving is not a person reading.
--   * **History has boundaries.** A member sees from where they joined,
--     unless they were granted more; the grant is recorded, not implied.
--   * **Everything is audited**, including the two exceptional paths:
--     membership transfer and owner recovery.
--
-- The whole feature sits behind a per-team capability flag and is invisible
-- until an operator turns it on. Nothing here changes an existing table's
-- behaviour.
